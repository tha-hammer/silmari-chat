# SAIUpgrade Skill

**Primary Purpose:** Generate prioritized upgrade recommendations for the user's existing AAI setup by understanding their context and discovering what's new in the ecosystem.

The skill runs **three parallel agent threads** that converge into personalized recommendations:

```
Thread 1: USER CONTEXT     Thread 2: SOURCE COLLECTION    Thread 3: INTERNAL REFLECTIONS
┌───────────────────┐     ┌───────────────────────┐      ┌───────────────────────┐
│ PRAXOS Analysis    │     │ Anthropic Sources     │      │ Algorithm Reflections │
│ Project Analysis  │     │ YouTube Channels      │      │ Q2: Algorithm fixes   │
│ Recent Work       │     │ Custom USER Sources   │      │ Q1: Execution errors  │
│ AAI System State  │     │ GitHub Trending       │      │ Sentiment weighting   │

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Upgrade** | "check for upgrades", "check sources", "any updates", "check Anthropic", "check YouTube", "upgrade", "sai upgrade" | `Workflows/Upgrade.md` |
| **MineReflections** | "mine reflections", "check reflections", "what have we learned", "internal improvements", "reflection insights" | `Workflows/MineReflections.md` |
| **AlgorithmUpgrade** | "algorithm upgrade", "upgrade algorithm", "improve the algorithm", "algorithm improvements", "fix the algorithm" | `Workflows/AlgorithmUpgrade.md` |
| **ResearchUpgrade** | "research this upgrade", "deep dive on [feature]", "further research" | `Workflows/ResearchUpgrade.md` |
| **FindSources** | "find upgrade sources", "find new sources", "discover channels" | `Workflows/FindSources.md` |

**Default workflow:** If user says "upgrade" or "check for upgrades" without specifics, run the **Upgrade** workflow. The Upgrade workflow automatically includes internal reflection mining as Thread 3.

---

## Primary Output Format

**Discoveries first. Recommendations second. Technique details third.**

The output has THREE major sections:
1. **Discoveries** — Everything found, ranked by interestingness, showing source and AAI relevance at a glance
2. **Recommendations** — What to actually integrate, organized by priority tier
3. **Technique Details** — Full extraction with code examples and implementation steps

```markdown
# AAI Upgrade Report
**Generated:** [timestamp]
**Sources Processed:** [N] release notes parsed | [N] videos checked | [N] docs analyzed | [N] GitHub queries run
**Findings:** [N] techniques extracted | [N] content items skipped

---

## ✨ Discoveries

Everything interesting we found, ranked by how compelling it is for AAI. This is the "what's out there" overview.

| # | Discovery | Source | Why It's Interesting | AAI Relevance |
|---|-----------|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| 1 | [Name of thing found] | [GitHub release / YouTube video / Docs / Blog] | [1-2 sentences: what makes this cool or notable] | [1 sentence: how it maps to AAI] |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Ranking rule:** Sort by interestingness — the most "whoa, that's cool" discoveries go at the top. This is NOT the same as implementation priority (that's the Recommendations section below). A LOW-priority awareness item can still be the most interesting discovery.

---

## 🔥 Recommendations

What to actually DO with these discoveries, organized by urgency and impact.

### 🔴 CRITICAL — Integrate immediately

These fix gaps, security issues, or unlock capabilities that AAI should already have.

| # | Recommendation | AAI Relevance | Effort | Files Affected |
|---|---------------|---------------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | [Short action name] | [Why this matters for AAI — what gap it fills or what breaks without it] | [Low/Med/High] | `[file1]`, `[file2]` |

### 🟠 HIGH — Integrate this week

These significantly improve AAI's capabilities or efficiency.

| # | Recommendation | AAI Relevance | Effort | Files Affected |
|---|---------------|---------------|--------|----------------|
| 2 | [Short action name] | [Which AAI component improves and how] | [Low/Med/High] | `[file1]` |

### 🟡 MEDIUM — Integrate when convenient

These add useful capabilities or align AAI with ecosystem best practices.

| # | Recommendation | AAI Relevance | Effort | Files Affected |
|---|---------------|---------------|--------|----------------|
| 3 | [Short action name] | [What becomes possible for AAI] | [Low/Med/High] | `[file1]` |

### 🟢 LOW — Awareness / future reference

These are nice-to-know or will become relevant later.

| # | Recommendation | AAI Relevance | Effort | Files Affected |
|---|---------------|---------------|--------|----------------|
| 4 | [Short action name] | [Why to keep this on the radar] | [Low/Med/High] | `[file1]` |

## Extraction Rules

**CRITICAL: Extract, don't summarize. Techniques, not recommendations.**

1. **Every output item must be a TECHNIQUE** - A specific pattern, code snippet, configuration, or approach
2. **Quote or code-block the actual content** - Show exactly what was said/written
3. **Map to AAI components** - Every technique must connect to a specific file, skill, workflow, or system component
4. **Two mandatory description fields (16-32 words each):**
   - **What It Is:** Describe the technique itself - what it does, how it works, what capability it provides
   - **How It Helps AAI:** Describe the specific benefit - which component improves, what gap it fills, what becomes possible
5. **Provide implementation** - Show before/after code or specific steps
6. **Skip, don't dilute** - If content has no extractable technique, put it in Skipped Content with reason

**Anti-patterns to AVOID:**
- ❌ "Check out this video for more"
- ❌ "This release has improvements"
- ❌ "Consider looking into this"
- ❌ Vague summaries without specific techniques
- ❌ Links without extracted content

**Source Type Labels:**
| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `GitHub: claude-code vX.Y.Z` | Specific version release notes |
| `YouTube: Creator @ MM:SS` | Video with timestamp |
| `Docs: Section Name` | Documentation section |
| `Blog: Post Title` | Blog post |

## The Two-Thread Architecture

### Thread 1: User Context Analysis

**Purpose:** Deeply understand the user to personalize recommendations.

Launch **parallel agents** to analyze:

| Agent | Focus | Sources |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **PRAXOS Agent** | User's goals, challenges, current focus | `AAI/USER/PRAXOS/*.md` |
| **Project Agent** | Active projects, tech stacks, dependencies | PRAXOS/PROJECTS.md, recent work context |
| **History Agent** | Recent work patterns, what's been done | `MEMORY/WORK/`, `MEMORY/STATE/current-work.json` |
| **AAI State Agent** | System capabilities, installed skills, gaps | `skills/`, `hooks/`, `settings.json` |

**Output:** A context object that includes:
- User's current focus areas and priorities
- Active projects and their tech stacks
- Recent work patterns and themes
- AAI system state and existing capabilities

### Thread 2: Source Collection

**Purpose:** Discover what's new in the ecosystem.

Launch **parallel agents** to check:

| Agent | Focus | Sources |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Anthropic Agent** | Official Anthropic updates | `Tools/Anthropic.ts` (30+ sources) |
| **YouTube Agent** | Configured channels for new videos | USER customization channels |
| **Custom Source Agent** | Any USER-defined additional sources | USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/AAIUpgrade/ |
| **GitHub Trending Agent** | Trending projects for AAI inspiration | `gh api search/repositories` via user-sources.json queries |

**Output:** A collection of discoveries:
- New features, releases, changes from Anthropic
- New videos with transcripts and key insights
- Updates from custom sources

---

## Process Flow

### Step 1: Launch Both Threads in Parallel

Using BACKGROUNDDELEGATION, spawn both analysis threads simultaneously:

```markdown
## Thread 1: User Context (4 parallel agents)

### Agent 1: PRAXOS Analysis
Read and analyze:
- ~/.claude/AAI-USER/PRAXOS/PRAXOS.md
- ~/.claude/AAI-USER/PRAXOS/GOALS.md
- ~/.claude/AAI-USER/PRAXOS/PROJECTS.md
- ~/.claude/AAI-USER/PRAXOS/CHALLENGES.md
- ~/.claude/AAI-USER/PRAXOS/STATUS.md

Extract: Current focus, priorities, active goals, project themes

### Agent 2: Recent Work Analysis
Read and analyze:
- ~/.claude/MEMORY/STATE/current-work.json
- Recent MEMORY/WORK/ directories

Extract: What user has been working on, patterns, open tasks

### Agent 3: AAI System State
Analyze:
- ~/.claude/skills/ (installed skills)
- ~/.claude/hooks/ (active hooks)
- ~/.claude/settings.json (configuration)

Extract: Current capabilities, potential gaps, system health

### Agent 4: Tech Stack Context
From PROJECTS and recent work, identify:
- Languages and frameworks in use
- Deployment targets
- Integration points

---

## Thread 2: Source Collection (3 parallel agents)

### Agent 1: Anthropic Sources
Run: bun ~/.claude/skills/Utilities/AAIUpgrade/Tools/Anthropic.ts
Check all 30+ official sources for updates

### Agent 2: YouTube Channels
Check configured channels for new videos
Extract transcripts from new content

### Agent 3: Custom Sources
Check any USER-defined additional sources
```

### Step 2: Synthesize Results

Once both threads complete:

1. **Merge context:** Combine user analysis into unified context object
2. **Filter discoveries:** Remove items that don't apply to user's stack/focus
3. **Score relevance:** Rate each discovery against user's PRAXOS and projects
4. **Prioritize:** Sort by (relevance to user × impact × ease)

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

For each discovery that passes relevance filtering:

1. **Personalize:** Explain why this matters for THIS user specifically
2. **Contextualize:** Map to their projects, goals, and challenges
3. **Actionize:** Provide concrete implementation steps
4. **Estimate:** Rate effort relative to their experience level

### Step 4: Output Report

Generate the prioritized recommendations report (see format above).

---

## Configuration

**Skill Files:**
- `sources.json` - Anthropic sources config (30+ sources)
- `youtube-channels.json` - Base YouTube channels (empty by default)
- `State/last-check.json` - Anthropic state
- `State/youtube-videos.json` - YouTube state
- `State/github-trending.json` - GitHub trending state (seen repos)

**User Customizations** (`~/.claude/AAI-USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/AAIUpgrade/`):
- `EXTEND.yaml` - Extension manifest
- `youtube-channels.json` - User's personal YouTube channels
- Additional source definitions

---

## Tool Reference

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Tools/Anthropic.ts` | Check Anthropic sources for updates |

---

## Key Principles

1. **Extract, Don't Summarize:** Pull specific techniques from content, never just link to sources
2. **Quote the Source:** Show actual code, documentation quotes, or transcript excerpts
3. **AAI-Contextualized:** Every technique maps to a specific AAI file, skill, or component
4. **Explain "Why You":** Use phrases like "This helps because your [X] currently [Y]"
5. **PRAXOS-Connected:** Reference user's goals and challenges when explaining relevance
6. **Skip Boldly:** If content has no extractable technique, skip it entirely
7. **Implementation-Ready:** Provide actual code changes, not vague recommendations

---

## Examples

**Example 1: Standard upgrade check**
```
User: "check for upgrades"
→ Launch Thread 1 (4 agents analyzing user context)
→ Launch Thread 2 (3 agents checking sources)
→ Wait for both threads
→ Synthesize into prioritized recommendations
→ Output personalized upgrade report
```

**Example 2: Quick Anthropic-only check**
```
User: "check Anthropic only"
→ Run Anthropic.ts tool directly
→ Use cached user context from recent session
→ Quick-match against user focus areas
→ Output filtered recommendations
```

---

## Workflows

- **Upgrade.md** - Primary workflow: full two-thread analysis with prioritized recommendations
- **ResearchUpgrade.md** - Deep dive on a specific upgrade opportunity
- **FindSources.md** - Discover and evaluate new sources to monitor

---

---

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Output)

These output patterns are **FAILURES**. If you produce these, you have not completed the skill correctly:

| ❌ Bad Output | Why It's Wrong | ✅ Correct Output |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| "Check out R Amjad's video on Claude Code" | Points to content instead of extracting it | "@ 5:42, R Amjad shows this technique: [quote]" |
| "v2.1.16 has task management improvements" | Vague summary, no technique | "v2.1.16 adds `addBlockedBy` parameter: [code example]" |
| "Consider looking into MCP updates" | Recommendation without extraction | "MCP now supports [specific feature]: [docs quote]" |
| "This could be useful for your workflows" | Vague relevance | "This improves your Browser skill because [specific gap it fills]" |
| "Several videos covered AI agents" | Count without content | "[N] videos skipped - no extractable techniques" |
| "This helps because it improves things" | Vague benefit, no word count | "How It Helps AAI (16-32 words): Our SecurityValidator currently only blocks commands. This technique enables injecting reasoning context before tool execution, making security decisions more nuanced." |
| "A new hook feature" | No description of what it IS | "What It Is (16-32 words): PreToolUse hooks can return additionalContext that gets injected into the model's context before execution, enabling reasoning-based decisions rather than binary blocks." |
| "Top 3 Actions" or flat recommendation list | No priority tiers — everything looks equally important | Recommendations section with 🔴 CRITICAL / 🟠 HIGH / 🟡 MEDIUM / 🟢 LOW tiers, each with AAI Relevance column |
| Recommendations at the bottom of the report | Actionable items buried after technique dump | 🔥 Recommendations section appears FIRST, technique details are reference material below |

**The test:** If you can say "show me the technique" and there's nothing to show, you've failed.

**Word count test:** Each "What It Is" and "How It Helps AAI" field MUST be 16-32 words. Count them. If under 16, add specificity. If over 32, condense.

---

**This skill embodies AAI's commitment to continuous, personalized improvement - understanding YOU first, then discovering what's new, then EXTRACTING the actual techniques that matter to your system.**
